## Airline Customer Segmentation 

Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting airline customers using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on customer behaviors and attributes. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enhance marketing strategies and customer experiences.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Airline Customer Segmentation Dataset available on Kaggle. It consists of various features that help in categorizing customers into meaningful segments.

Project Workflow

The following steps were followed to develop the customer segmentation model:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted an initial analysis of the dataset to understand customer distribution and characteristics.

Distribution Check

Examined the distribution of key features to identify patterns and anomalies.

Standardization

Applied feature scaling to standardize the data for better clustering performance.

Correlation Analysis

Analyzed feature correlations to understand relationships between variables.

PCA Analysis & Clustering

Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve clustering accuracy.

Applied KMeans clustering to group customers into meaningful segments.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning & clustering)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

How to Use

Clone this repository.

Install the required dependencies.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for analysis and clustering.

Use the segmented customer data for further analysis or marketing strategies.

Conclusion

This project successfully segments airline customers using KMeans clustering. The insights from the segmentation can help airlines tailor their services and marketing strategies to different customer groups.
